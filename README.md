# future_teller
The code written in Arduino IDE with ESP32 dev kit. As part of a Fest event ,we made a game which gives a random answer to a pre-input questions which can be chosen by the player by pressing buttons on a keypad . A random answer generating algorithm is made which gives answer to question of the user. To make it attractive , ultrasonic sensor and motors are used , such that when the hand is placed on a glass board , the process starts and motors are used to simulate the scanning of the hand as in xerox machines.
